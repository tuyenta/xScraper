**Automatic PDF Scraper from Google with Keywords**

This is a python library to automatically scrape pdf documents in google search.

## Introduction

I have worked on a lot of document-related projects. Downloading hundreds of documents files  *manually* was a nightmare.

One question is always on my mind: *how can I automatically download all the necessary documents for each project?*

To answer that question, I started with one specific object: **pdf**-format documents. Such kind of document accounts for the majority of document-related AI projects nowadays, from document classification, information extraction, table extraction, structure recognition, etc. This is also the type of material that is used frequently in many different fields.
